# Introduction
In this notebook, we will be training **six** different neural network architectures to show how **convolutions** helps improve image classification performance considerably despite using less parameters.

This is inspired by a [convolutional neural network (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) called [LeNet-5](https://paperswithcode.com/method/lenett) ðŸ‘‡, created by one of the AI Godfathers [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun), that popularized the use of [convolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution) in deep learning.

For fun, I made a *Cat vs Dog Dataset* from [CIFAR10](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/cifar-10)  to compare these neural networks.

**TLDR**: Convolutions works!
